Starfire version of the Michelle 4.0 board. This one is dual polarity so doen't work (as built) with P12 system remote balanced microphones but does work with Matt Perk's orginal capsule and head design in addition to the simple heads like Woody and Minima. The LED positions have been moved since these images were done but the board remains the same.
